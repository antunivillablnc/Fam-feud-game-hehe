Reflect on how HTML was used to structure the web system interface and suggest one enhancement to improve the HTML structure or semantics.

	The HTML code effectively structures the web interface for a "Family Feud" game, utilizing semantic elements such as headings, lists, and forms to organize game content and inputs. However, one enhancement that could improve the structure and semantics of this page is the use of more meaningful HTML5 tags, like <header>, <nav>, and <main>. These elements would clearly define the navigation, main content, and game area, improving both the code's readability and accessibility for users and assistive technologies. This enhancement creates a more semantically rich and well-organized document, benefiting both developers and end users.

Discuss how you used CSS to style the web system and suggest one improvement for the visual design or layout.

	The CSS code styles the web system with a clean, modern aesthetic, focusing on dark backgrounds with bright, contrasting text and buttons. Flexbox is used effectively for layout, creating a responsive interface, particularly in the navigation menu and input forms. Key design choices include hover effects for buttons and navigation links, rounded corners for buttons and containers, and the use of color contrast for readability. One improvement for the visual design could be optimizing the background image for readability. Instead of using a tiled background image that repeats across the page, setting a single, full-screen background with background-size: cover and reducing opacity could create a cleaner, more professional look while maintaining the visual focus on the game content. This would prevent the background from overwhelming the interface and improve the overall user experience.

Explain how you implemented Java Script to handle interactions in the web system and suggest one enhancement to improve the functionality or user experience.

	The JavaScript code effectively manages the interactions of the Family Feud web system, handling user inputs, switching turns, and revealing answers. It uses functions to check submitted answers, switch between teams, randomly select the first team, reset the game, and announce the winner. This creates a smooth, interactive experience where players can compete and submit answers dynamically, with real-time feedback provided through alerts and visual indicators. One improvement for enhancing functionality and user experience would be to implement more visual feedback and animation effects for correct and incorrect answers. For instance, adding animations or color changes when an answer is revealed or when the turn changes would make the gameplay more engaging and immersive. Additionally, providing feedback directly on the page (e.g., a success or error message) instead of relying solely on alert boxes could improve the flow of the game.
